# Problem Statement

The challenge is to employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify features indicative of 'risky' loan applicants, labeled as 'charged-off' or defaulters. By pinpointing these risk factors, the goal is to minimize credit loss, allowing lenders to make informed decisions and reduce financial liabilities.
